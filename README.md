## About

<p>This Landing Page was part of a challenge for an Entry-level Full-Stack Role focusing on Frontend by <a href="https://web3.sonica.digital/">Sonica Digital</a>.</p>
<p>This was my first time using Next.js 13 and Framer Motion, so it was a great learning experience on all levels. Besides, I had a great time developing this project.</p>
<p>You can explore it by clicking <a href="https://sonica-frontend-challenge.vercel.app/">here</a>.</p>

<h6 align="center">The project was deployed on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>.</h6>
